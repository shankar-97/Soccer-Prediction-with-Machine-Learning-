# Soccer-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-

Used web-scrapping to extract EPL soccer data(results of matches) for the past 20 years from various sources. Merged the EPL soccer data with transfer
data(number of players signed by the club). Used various machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors, Gradient Boosting,
Random Forest, also trained and tested the dataset to predict the next year table standings(The team that will win the championship and the points that
they wiill score).
